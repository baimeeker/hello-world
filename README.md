# hello-world
First github repository
Hi everyone!  My name is Bailey Meeker.  I am an experienced analytics professional in the Columbus, OH area.  I worked at Cardinal Health as a "Consultant, Advanced Analytics" for nearly three years.  I was downsized in early June 2017, and I am currently looking for a new position.
I am new to github, as we did not use it in my last job.  I hope that by creating some new, open source data science projects I can show you what I am capable of.

Thank you for your interest. 
Bailey Meeker
